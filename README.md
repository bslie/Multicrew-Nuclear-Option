## Limitations and things to note ##
Every attempt has been made to make this mod as seamless as possible, but there are some unfortunate caveats:
- MFDs do not work for the gunner, they still work for the pilot but its an area I did not want to touch for 1.0, potentially in the future I will attempt to get the vanilla ones working.
-  WSO does not have flight control, a given but it means you can't take over sticks if they need to leave or AFK
-  WSO does not have counter measures, no design reason why they do not, I just did not see it as a priority because the pilot needs SOMETHING to do.

## Configuration ## 
I've set up camera positions (Gunner camera offset cycleable with K) for most of the vanilla two+ seater aircraft. Often placed where the "targeting pod" is on most aircraft e.g. the Cricket, Compass, Chichane. For the Ibis and Tarantula the
additional camera views are on the "gun" positions, so door guns for Ibis and side gun for the Tarantula

You can change these camera offsets along with keybinds and an option so that when a target list is shared between Pilot and Gunner and vice versa it can either fully replace or append the target lists, based on how much you trust your other 
crewman.

BepInEx Configuration Manager (https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager or downloadable via NOMM) is the easiest way to change these. You just press F1 in game. Otherwise you can change the settings in: 
\Nuclear Option\BepInEx\config\nuclearoption.simplewso.cfg
